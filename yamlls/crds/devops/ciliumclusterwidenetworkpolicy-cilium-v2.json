The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",

The IPs that result from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",
